    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>Hello, I create this small website regarding mental health because many of my friends go through mental health
      issues (depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, etc). I want others to know that they are free to vent and their
      experiences are valid. I want to create judgement free/positive website for those who can not get it in their
      personal lives. There are many resources can try going to when your mental health is at a low-point.</p>
    <p>As for why I chose HotCoco as the name? I believe that hot cocoa can help warm someone's day. It doesn't have
      to
      be hot cocoa. It can be any beverage, any small deed that can make someone feel happy! ☕</p>
